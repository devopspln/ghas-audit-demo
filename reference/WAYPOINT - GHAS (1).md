| 1 | Monitor and Report Security Issues in GHAS Learning Objectives: *Copy and paste verbatim from Learning Objective table above* **1\. Monitor and Report Security Issues in GitHub Advanced Security** Access and interpret GHAS security dashboards at org and repo levels Generate comprehensive security reports for compliance documentation Track resolved versus unresolved security alerts across repositories Communicate security findings effectively to stakeholders  Module Layout:  *Explain how you will be teaching the learning objectives and incorporating your storyline. List and describe any demos, learning activities or exercise files you will be using.*  **Module Layout:**Explain how you will be teaching the learning objectives and incorporating your storyline. List and describe any demos, learning activities or exercise files you will be using. **Kickoff Scenario:**Globomantics' ISO auditor arrives in 30 days. Leadership needs a clear picture of our security posture across 200+ repos. I've been asked to create a monitoring and reporting system using GHAS dashboards. **Learning Objective:**I'll show you how to navigate GHAS security dashboards, interpret security metrics, generate compliance reports, and communicate findings to both technical teams and executives. **Slide Content:** GHAS Security Overview architecture: org vs repo level dashboards Key metrics that matter: open/resolved alerts, severity distribution, trend analysis Security alert types: code scanning, secret scanning, dependency vulnerabilities Dashboard filtering and drill-down techniques Export options and API access for custom reporting Creating compliance evidence packages **Demo:**I'll navigate Globomantics' live GHAS dashboards, showing a real security overview with mixed alert states. We'll filter by severity, export data for compliance, and create an executive summary report template. **Visual:**Dashboard hierarchy diagram showing org → repo → alert flow, plus a sample executive report template **Takeaway:**GHAS dashboards aren't just for developers—they're your compliance command center. Master these views and you'll always know your security posture at a glance. | 15 min |
| 2 | Automate Security Workflows Using GitHub APIs Learning Objectives: *Copy and paste verbatim from Learning Objective table above* **2\. Automate Security Workflows Using GitHub APIs** Access security alert data using GitHub REST and GraphQL APIs Build automated notification systems for security alerts Integrate GHAS data with external security and compliance tools Implement GitHub Actions for automated security enforcement  Module Layout:  *Explain how you will be teaching the learning objectives and incorporating your storyline. List and describe any demos, learning activities or exercise files you will be using.*  Globomantics has 50+ dev teams who need real-time security alerts. Manual monitoring won't scale. I'm tasked with building automated workflows that push GHAS data to Slack, email, and our SIEM system. **Learning Objective:**I'll demonstrate how to access GHAS data via APIs, build notification bots, integrate with external tools, and create GitHub Actions that enforce security policies automatically. **Slide Content:** GitHub API architecture: REST vs GraphQL for security data Authentication and rate limits for automation Key API endpoints for alerts, vulnerabilities, and audit logs Building notification workflows with webhooks GitHub Actions for security automation Integration patterns for SIEM and compliance tools **Demo:**I'll build a Slack bot that posts critical security alerts in real-time. Then we'll create a GitHub Action that blocks PRs with high-severity vulnerabilities and logs compliance events. **Visual:**API workflow diagram: GHAS → API → Bot → Slack/Email/SIEM **Takeaway:**APIs transform GHAS from a dashboard into an automation engine. Once you master these integrations, security compliance runs itself.   | 15 mins |
| 3 | Implement Compliance Best Practices Using GHAS Learning Objectives: *Copy and paste verbatim from Learning Objective table above*  **3\. Implement Compliance Best Practices Using GHAS** Align GHAS security practices with OWASP, NIST, and ISO standards Configure organization-wide security policies and baselines Maintain comprehensive audit logs for compliance tracking Establish periodic security review processes  Module Layout:  *Explain how you will be teaching the learning objectives and incorporating your storyline. List and describe any demos, learning activities or exercise files you will be using.*  **Kickoff Scenario:**Our ISO 27001 auditor wants evidence that we follow OWASP Top 10 and NIST guidelines. I need to map GHAS features to specific compliance controls and prove we maintain proper audit trails. **Learning Objective:**I'll show you how to align GHAS with compliance frameworks, set organization-wide policies, maintain audit logs, and establish review processes that satisfy auditors. **Slide Content:** Mapping GHAS to compliance frameworks: OWASP, NIST, ISO controls Organization security settings and policy templates Branch protection rules for compliance enforcement Audit log architecture and retention strategies Building compliance checklists and review schedules Documentation standards for audit evidence **Demo:**I'll configure Globomantics' org-wide security policies, demonstrate audit log queries for compliance evidence, and show how to map GHAS alerts to OWASP Top 10 categories. **Visual:**Compliance mapping matrix showing GHAS features → Framework controls **Takeaway:**Compliance isn't about checking boxes—it's about proving your security practices work. GHAS gives you the evidence auditors need.    | 15 mins |
